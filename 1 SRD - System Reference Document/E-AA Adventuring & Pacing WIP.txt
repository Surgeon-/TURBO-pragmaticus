Tracking and measuring time and tension is done according to The Angry GM's
Time/Tension pool mechanic:
	1. https://theangrygm.com/tension-on-the-road/
	2. https://theangrygm.com/making-things-complicated/
	
With the following time scales:
    - 10 seconds (1 sequence round)
		6 × 10 seconds = 1 minute
	- 10 minutes
	    6 × 10 minutes = 1 hour
	- 4 hours
	    6 × 4 hours = 1 day
	- 1 day
	    6 × 1 day = 1 week (1 missing day is hand-waved away)
		
	When shifting between time scales:
		If going from a less granular to more granular time scale, no special
		action is needed (just keep the dice as they are).
		ex. days -> hours
		"inflation"
		
		If going from a more granular to less granular time scale, roll
		all the dice in the pool (introduce a complication if there are any
		1s), then clear the pool.
		ex. seconds -> minutes
		"deflation"
		
Resting:
	- Short Rest:    [5 to 10 minutes]
		Limitation: cannot do 1 hour after any kind of rest
		Effect: Lose d3 Fatigue points
		
	- Medium rest:   [1 to a few hours]
		Limitation: cannot do 4 hours after a medium, long or full-day rest
		Effect: Lose 2d3 Fatigue Points
		
	- Long Rest:     [about 8 hours]
		Limitation: once per day
		Effect: Lose all Fatigue points
		        Lose 1 Exhaustion point
				Lose 1 Stress point
				Advance healing cycle
		
	- Full-day Rest: [the whole day - 24 hours]
		Limitation: once per day (obviously)
		Effect: Effect: Lose all Fatigue points
		        Lose 1 Exhaustion point
				Lose 2 Stress points
				Advance healing cycle (+3 automatic successes)
				
Practicing:
	You can practice either a Skill or a Specialization. In either way, you
	must find something relevant to do and describe how you're practicing.
	> It takes 4 hours in both cases. <
	
	- Practice a Skill:
		Roll 3d10. If any die rolls higher than your current Rank with that
		Skill, you may receive a Routine PROG for that Skill. Getting a
		Difficult PROG requires at least two dice to ge higher that your
		current Rank, and if all three are higher, you may get a Challenging
		PROG.
		
		Get a Fatigue point for each die that rolled 6 or higher.
		
	- Practice a Specialization:
		You automatically get one PROG, but you still roll 3d10 and get a
		Fatigue point for each one that turns up with a 6 or higher.
