GRAVITAS

Joint Action: When you use this action, do not discard the action die you just used. Instead,
increase it by 1 (up to a maximum of 6) and give it to an adjecent ally. They can now
immediately use it to perform one standard action, or save it for later. A single character
can be targeted by Joint Action only once during a cycle. 
If:
 - The targeted character chooses to use the action die immediately,
 - He is currently engaged, and
 - You're engaged with the same characters as he is,
You may expose yourself to make him immune to attacks of opportunity
for that one action he is about to perform.

MAGIC INTRO:

1) Limbonic Art - A Misanthrophic Spectrum

	The magic sights of thy third eye
	Triumphant wargod rising tall
	Sparkling rain falls from the sky
	When thunder`s blasting heavens wall

2) Limbonic Art - Solace Of The Shadows

	I set the stones for invoking ceremonies
	In the twilight zones arise abstract galaxies
	The magic eye unveils the blackened skies
	A new horizon begins to each one that die
