Booming Voice:
	This character’s voice cuts through

	This is a call-on for Conspicuous,
	Oratory or Command.

	Eat and eat and eat. °‘Natu1'e°s
	Cruel Joke.” Characters with the
	Bottomless Stomach trait are
	at +1 Ob to all Resources tests
	involving food, drink and meals.
	
Cipher:
	It is not that the character is
	completely nondescript, but there
	is something about him that makes
	people not notice him. This trait
	shade shifts lnconspicuous to gray,
	but adds +1 Ob to all Circles tests.
	
Claustrophobia:
	Claustrophobia is a specific phobia
	applying to enclosed spaces. A
	character afflicted with this trait
	will not willingly enter small spaces
	like prison cells, closets, t11nnels,
	tru11ks or even cramped rooms. If he
	should find himself i11 a11 enclosed
	space for along period of time (more
	than a 111in11te or two), he becomes
	agitated and eventually l1ysterical——
	the character 1n11st pass a Steel test.
	If failed, he n111st either Swoon or
	Run and Scream.
	
Commanding:
	This character possesses an
	imperious and imposing demeanor.
	His merest words seem like fiat and
	his statements like edicts. His lessers
	feel compelled to obey. Add +lD
	to the character’s Command skill.
	He may also help all those in his
	presence with any Steel tests they are
	compelled to make.
	
Entrophic:
	Things fall apart around the
	cl1aracter. Any mechanic that
	involves something breaking—
	armor or materials, for exan1plecounts
	double in its effect. One
	breach counts as two, one lost
	armor die counts as two. Any DoF
	mechanic for catastrophic failure
	is weighted by +1 toward the worst
	result. And any roll that results
	in complete failure indicates that
	something broke. Oops. This trait
	affects everyone a11d everything i11
	the characte1"s presence, including
	himself.
