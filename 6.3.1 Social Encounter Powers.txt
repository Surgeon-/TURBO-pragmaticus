???:
	Person forgets you after the encounter
	BitD = Mesmerism: When you Sway someone, you may cause them to forget
	that it's happened until they next interact with you.
	
Confabulator:
	Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the
	circumstance bonus a target gains for your previous attempts
	to Create a Diversion or Lie to it from +4 to +2. If you’re a master
	in Deception, reduce the bonus to +1, and if you’re legendary,
	your targets don’t get these bonuses at all.
	
Cloak & Dagger: When you use a disguise or other form of covert
misdirection, you get +1d to rolls to confuse or deflect suspicion.
When you throw off your disguise, the resulting surprise gives 
you the initiative in the situation.

intimate relationship.

Dubious Knowledge:
	You’re a treasure trove of information, but not all of it comes
	from reputable sources. When you fail a Recall Knowledge
	check using any skill, you learn a bit of true knowledge and
	a bit of erroneous knowledge, but you don’t have any way to
	differentiate which is which

Language stuff...

Booming Voice:
	This character’s voice cuts through
	walls and overpowers otl1er speakers.
	This is a call-on for Conspicuous,
	Oratory or Command.
	
Bottomless Stomach:
	Eat and eat and eat. °‘Natu1'e°s
	Cruel Joke.” Characters with the
	Bottomless Stomach trait are
	at +1 Ob to all Resources tests
	involving food, drink and meals.
	
Cipher:
	It is not that the character is
	completely nondescript, but there
	is something about him that makes
	people not notice him. This trait
	shade shifts lnconspicuous to gray,
	but adds +1 Ob to all Circles tests.
	
Claustrophobia:
	Claustrophobia is a specific phobia
	applying to enclosed spaces. A
	character afflicted with this trait
	will not willingly enter small spaces
	like prison cells, closets, t11nnels,
	tru11ks or even cramped rooms. If he
	should find himself i11 a11 enclosed
	space for along period of time (more
	than a 111in11te or two), he becomes
	agitated and eventually l1ysterical——
	the character 1n11st pass a Steel test.
	If failed, he n111st either Swoon or
	Run and Scream.
	
Commanding:
	This character possesses an
	imperious and imposing demeanor.
	His merest words seem like fiat and
	his statements like edicts. His lessers
	feel compelled to obey. Add +lD
	to the character’s Command skill.
	He may also help all those in his
	presence with any Steel tests they are
	compelled to make.
	
Entrophic:
	Things fall apart around the
	cl1aracter. Any mechanic that
	involves something breaking—
	armor or materials, for exan1plecounts
	double in its effect. One
	breach counts as two, one lost
	armor die counts as two. Any DoF
	mechanic for catastrophic failure
	is weighted by +1 toward the worst
	result. And any roll that results
	in complete failure indicates that
	something broke. Oops. This trait
	affects everyone a11d everything i11
	the characte1"s presence, including
	himself.
	
BW Lucky

Poker Face:
	More than just an inscrutable stone
	face, Poker Face is all about giving
	the face you need to mislead your
	opponent. This trait can be used as a
	call-on for Falsehood and Cambling/
	Games of Chance.
	
Possessed:
	This special trait may only be
	chosen after consultation with the
	GM and/or other players. If it is
	take11, the character is possessed by
	a daemon, spirit or seraph. Choose
	one appropriate trait to be made
	manifest through the human vessel
	from the daemon/seraph list in the
	Monster Burner. I recommend that
	Lawbreaker con1e along with any
	and all choices, but it°s not required.
	Once the nature of the possession
	is determined, the player and the
	GM need to devise a separate set
	of Beliefs and Instincts for the
	possessing spirit. When these come
	i11to conflict with the character°s
	own BlTs, a versus Will test must
	be made—tl1e spirit against the
	cl1aracter. Use the appropriate Will
	from the stat blocks in the Monster
	Burner. Whoever wins the test can
	enact his Belief or Instinct.
	A Possessed person can be exorcised
	as per the Faith mechanics in
	the Burning Wheel. Whether or
	not he wants to be exorcised is
	another matter. Also, the Possessed
	character°s aura (for Aura Reading)
	will show the additional trait and
	the additional set of Beliefs and
	Instincts.
	
???:
	Regain 1 "social HP" when you would lose
	[once per encounter]
	
Wise Aphorisms:
	Use this a caIl—on for
	Persuasion, Oratory, Interrogation or
	Seduction if the player can co111e up
	with some appropriately sagacious
	dialogue to throw into play at the
	right moment.
