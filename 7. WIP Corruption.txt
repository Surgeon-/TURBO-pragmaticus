Head, 2×Leg, 2×Arm -> 12 pts each (60 total)
	- Modification @ 4, 8 and 12 pts
Torso -> 20 pts (20 total)
	- Modification @ 5, 10, 15 and 20 pts

Total Corruption = [0..80]

Corruption reduces Stress Tolerance (1ST per 10 Corruption)

When wounded, roll a d12 (d20 if the torso is hit):
	if roll <= corruption amount then the wound is mechanical
	otherwise it's normal
